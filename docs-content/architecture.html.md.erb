## How it works

![alt-text="Synopsys Black Duck Service Broker Architecture"](images/blackduckpcfarchitecture-v2.png)

The Synopsys Black Duck Service Broker for VMware Tanzu Architecture is based off the
<a href="https://github.com/blackducksoftware/perceptor">Black Duck perceptor open
source project</a>, which is an API server and event handler for consuming, storing,
and queueing various workloads associated with responding to events that occur
in distributed orchestration systems. When <a href="installing.html">installed
into the VMware Tanzu Ops Manager</a>,the Black Duck Service Broker behaves in the following manner:

1. The developer first creates the Black Duck service, and then binds it to their app.

1. The developer then runs the *cf push* command.

1. As the app is built and packaged into a droplet, the Black Duck Service Broker's
droplet perceiver component picks up the new droplet creation event through the
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client">*cf-java-client*</a> SDK, which
interfaces the Cloud Controller API.

1. The scanner component is polling the core perceptor component for any new droplets, and
invokes the droplet fa√ßade to download and store the droplet in a location where the
scanner component executes a Black Duck scan on the droplet.

1. After the scan completes, open source metadata information is displayed in Black
Duck such as:
	* Security
	* License
	* Operational risk
	* Policy violation status
